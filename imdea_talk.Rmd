# Functional Data Analysis (FDA)

---


# What is Functional Data Analysis?  

- FDA deals with analysing data *that can be considered as* **curves** or **functions**. 

- In FDA, a single observation is a curve or function over some domain. 

- In univariate data analysis, each data point is a single number, $x\in \mathbb{R}$.

- In multivariate data analysis, each data point is a vector of $p$ dimension: 
$$\textbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^p; \ \ \ \ \  p \in \mathbb{Z}. $$
- In FDA, each data point is assumed to be: 
  - Infinite dimensional function. 
  - Continuous on its domain
  - Can be evaluated at any point on the domain. 

- In reality the domain can be: the real line $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R}^p$ or more complex sets or intervals.


- We focus our attention on functions defined on  $\mathbb{R}$.

# Functional data example

- Daily average temperature between 1980-2009 from 73 weather stations<sup>*</sup>

```{r, eval=T, echo=F, fig.retina = 2, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("gfx/aemet_spanish_raw_functional.png")
```

# Dealing with functions

- Functions are assumed to be square integrable, defined on the unit interval $[0,1]$: 
$$\int f^2(t)dt = \int_0^1 f(t)^2 < \infty.$$
- Denote by $L^2[0,1]$, the set of all square integrable functions. Then $L^2[0,1]$ is a vector space and we can define the inner product of two functions: 
$$\langle f, g\rangle = \int_0^1 f(t)g(t)dt$$
- Define the norm of a function as the square root of its inner product with itself: 
$$\lVert f \rVert =  \langle f, f\rangle \ = \left( \int_0^1 f(t)^2dt \right)^{1/2}$$

- Now we can measure the distance between two functions $f$ and $g$: 
$$d(f, g) = \lVert f - g\rVert$$


---

# Objectives of FDA

- Rather than random variable, we now deal with **random functions**.
- Each observed function is now a realization of a random function. 
- Just like in univariate and multivariate data analysis: 
  - We can do exploratory analysis and visualization
  - Modelling and hypothesis testing
  - Classification and Clustering

- **Exploratory Analysis** deals with data representation, smoothing, [outlier detection](https://link.springer.com), visualization, dimension reduction using PCA. 

- **Modelling**: deals with regression in functional settings: 
  - scalar on function regression
  - function on function regression etc.
  

- **Classification and Clustering**: deals with classifying and clustering functional observations.

# Outlier Detection

---

# What is an outlier in functional setting?

- An outlier is an observation generated by a functional random variable with a different distribution from the one generating the normal observations of a functional sample. <sup>*</sup>
- Since we dealing with functions over a domain: 
  - An outlier can be outlying all through the domain: **persistent outliers**
  - An outlier can be outlying for a small part of the domain. **non-persistent outliers**

- Also a persistent outlier can show different outlying behaviours:
  - **shift/magnitude outlier:** curves with the same shape with *normal observations* but displaced vertically or horizontally away from the mass of the data. 
  
  - **Amplitude outliers:** curves that have similar trend/shape as the majority but with different scale/amplitude (applies mostly to periodic curves). 
  
  - **shape outliers:** curves whose shape differs from the majority

- It is desirable to identify type of a functional outlier.

# Proposal

- We propose two methods that compute three outlyingness indices for each functional observation

- The three outlyingness indices are: 
  - **Amplitude index** denoted by $I_A$,
  - **Magnitude index** (denoted by $I_M$)
  - **Shape index** (denoted by $I_S$)
  
- We call the two methods:
  - **Fast-MUOD**
  - **Semifast-MUOD**. 

---

# Fast-MUOD

- Let $Y = \{Y_1(t), Y_2(t), \ldots, Y_n(t)\}$ be the set of functional observations of interest.  

- Denote by $\tilde{Y}(t)$, pointwise median of $Y$ (or any other type of median of $Y$).

- We define the Fast-MUOD shape index of function $Y_i$ w.r.t. to $\tilde{Y}$ as:
$$I_S(Y_i, \tilde{Y}) := |r(Y_i(t), \tilde{Y}(t)) - 1|,$$ where $r(Y_i(t), \tilde{Y}(t))$ is the estimated *Pearson correlation correlation coefficient* between the points of $Y_i(t)$ and $\tilde{Y}(t)$. 


- We define the Fast-MUOD amplitude index of function $Y_i$ w.r.t. to $\tilde{Y}$ as:
$$I_A(Y_i, \tilde{Y}) = |\beta_i - 1|,$$ where $\beta_i$ is the estimated *slope* of a simple linear regression line between the points of $Y_i(t)$ and $\tilde{Y}(t)$ given by: $$\beta_i = \frac{\text{cov}(Y_i, \tilde{Y})}{\text{var}(\tilde{Y})}; \ \ \ \ \text{var}(\tilde Y)\ne 0$$



---
# Fast-MUOD

- We define the Fast-MUOD magnitude index of function $Y_i$ w.r.t. to $\tilde{Y}$ as:
$$I_M(Y_i, \tilde{Y}) = |\alpha_i|,$$ where $\alpha_i$ is the estimated *intercept* of a simple linear regression line between the points of $Y_i(t)$ and $\tilde{Y}(t)$.

# Semifast-MUOD

- Compute the three indices w.r.t. a reference sample drawn from $Y$.

- The sampling proportion $p \in [0,1]$ is fixed.  

- Denote by $X = \{X_i(t)\}_{i = 1}^{n_X}$, the random sample selected from $Y$ without replacement, where $n_X$ is the sample size. 

- We define the Semifast-MUOD shape index of function $Y_i$ w.r.t. to $F_X$, the empirical distribution of $X$ as:
$$I_S(Y_i, F_X) := \left| \frac{1}{n_X} \sum_{j = 1}^{n_X} r(Y_i(t), X_j(t)) - 1 \right|,$$ where $r(Y_i(t), X_j(t))$ is the estimated *Pearson correlation correlation coefficient* between the points of $Y_i(t)$ and $X_j(t)$. 


---
# Semifast-MUOD
- We define the Semifast-MUOD amplitude index of function $Y_i$ w.r.t. to $F_X$ as:
$$I_A(Y_i, F_X) := \left|\frac{1}{n_X} \sum_{j = 1}^{n_X} \beta_j - 1 \right|,$$ where $\beta_j$ is the estimated *slope* of a simple linear regression line between the points of $Y_i(t)$ and ${X}_j(t)$ given by: $$\beta_j = \frac{\text{cov}(Y_i, X_j )}{\text{var}(X_j)}; \ \ \ \ \text{var}(X_j)\ne 0$$


- We define the Semifast-MUOD magnitude index of function $Y_i$ w.r.t. to $F_X$ as:
$$I_M(Y_i, F_X) = \left| \frac{1}{n_X} \sum_{j = 1}^{n_X} \alpha_j\right|,$$ where $\alpha_j$ is the estimated *intercept* of a simple linear regression line between the points of $Y_i(t)$ and $X_j(t)$.

# Next steps...

- For each functional observation $Y_i(t) \in Y$,  compute the three indices $I_A(Y_i), I_S(Y_i)$ and $I_M(Y_i)$. 

- Apply a classical boxplot (individually) to the three univariate data sets: $\{I_A(Y_i)\}_{i = 1}^n$, $\{I_M(Y_i)\}_{i = 1}^n$, and $\{I_S(Y_i)\}_{i = 1}^n$ to separate the indices of the outliers from non-outliers. 

- Obtain the three set of outliers: 
  - Amplitude outliers from the boxplot applied on $\{I_A(Y_i)\}_1^n$.
  - Magnitude outliers from the boxplot applied on $\{I_M(Y_i)\}_1^n$.
  - Shape outliers from the boxplot applied on $\{I_S(Y_i)\}_1^n$.
  
- Classification of the outliers are **not mutually exclusive**, i.e.,
  -an observation $Y_i$ can simultaneously be a shape, amplitude and magnitude outlier.

- The classification into various outlier type is done automatically **without the need for intervention or visualization** (useful for big functional data that are difficult to visualize).

# Surveillance Video Data

- A surveillance video data named *WalkByShop1front* <sup>*</sup> 

- Filmed by a camera across the hallway in a shopping centre in Lisbon. 

- Shows the front of a clothing store with people walking through the corridor in front of the shop. 

- **Objective** Identify points in video when people pass by the front of the store (outliers).

--

- Video is 94s @ 25FPS which gives a total of $2359$ frames.

- Each of the frame is made up of $384 \times 288 = 110,592$ pixels. 

- We convert the RGB values of each pixels to gray scale

- We consider each frame as a functional data observed on $110,592$ points.

- The constructed functional data is $2359$ curves observed on $110,592$ domain points.

# Video Data Results Summary

- 294 *unique frames* flagged as outliers :
 - 216 shape outliers
 - 206 amplitude outliers
 - 194 magnitude outliers
 
- Outlier classes are not mutually exclusive
- 125 outliers are simultaneously amplitude, magnitude and shape outliers.
- All outliers flagged correspond to frames with people passing by font of store (*no false positive*)

- Some pocket of frames with people were not flagged as outliers (frames with little contrast between the person and the store background).

- Comparison with competing methods:
  - **TVD** flagged all frames as outliers (*after running for 9hrs., compared to 42s for Fast-MUOD*)
  - **MSPLOT** didn't produce any result due to some *computational error*

#Conclusion and Summary

- High level description of Functional Data Analysis (FDA)

- Description of outliers in functional setting

- We proposed two methods:
  - **Fast-MUOD**
  - **Semifast-MUOD**
  
- Both methods are **unbelievably simple**, yet effective.

- Type of outlier is provided by the methods automatically.

- **Fast-MUOD** is scalable. 
  
- We show good performance of the methods, especially **Fast-MUOD** using various simulated and real data sets.
